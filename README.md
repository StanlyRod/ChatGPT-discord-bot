# Discord ChatGPT Bot
A simple Discord bot powered with ChatGPT.

This repository contains a Python-based Discord bot that integrates with OpenAI's ChatGPT API to provide AI-driven responses to user prompts. The bot listens for messages in a Discord channel that start with the > character and returns a response generated by the ChatGPT model.

### Features

- Responds to user prompts in Discord channels using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
- Handles errors gracefully, including OpenAI API errors and Discord message length limits.
- Provides detailed error messages for common issues like exceeding token limits or rate limits.
- Easy integration with environmental variables for secure API key management.

### Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher 
- Discord bot token
- OpenAI API key

### Note
- > ⚠️ **Check your Python version: Run python --version to check the version of Python you're using.**
- > ⚠️ **If using Python 3.13 or above: You'll need to find an alternative library for audio manipulation.**
- > ⚠️ **If using Python 3.11 or 3.12: You can still use audioop, but consider migrating to an alternative library.**
- > ⚠️ **Install audioop-lts: For projects like discord.py that require audioop on newer Python versions, you can install the audioop-lts package:**
```bash
pip install audioop-lts
```

### Note
> ⚠️ **Use greater than symbol '>'**
3. Make sure to use the greater than symbol '>' before any prompt,
if the bot sees a prompt without the > prefix, it responds with a reminder:
"Every prompt needs to start with a greater than sign '>'.
Try again." This helps users quickly understand how to interact with the bot effectively.

### Note
> ⚠️ **When using the Discord API to send messages to a channel, it is crucial to be specific in your prompt and token usage to avoid exceeding Discord's 2,000-character limit per message.
> This limit includes all text, emojis, and formatting (e.g., Markdown or embeds). If the ChatGPT API response exceeds 2,000 characters, the bot will raise a discord.errors.HTTPException and send the following message to the Discord channel:

"Discord HTTP Exception: The response exceeds 2,000 characters. Try again with a shorter prompt."**
