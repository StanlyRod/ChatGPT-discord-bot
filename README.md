# Discord ChatGPT Bot

### Features

- Responds to user prompts in Discord channels using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
- Handles errors gracefully, including OpenAI API errors and Discord message length limits.
- Provides detailed error messages for common issues like exceeding token limits or rate limits.
- Easy integration with environmental variables for secure API key management.
